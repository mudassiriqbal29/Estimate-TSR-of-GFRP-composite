The application, titled Prediction Application, was designed using a streamlit package in Pycharm. It is designed to predict the property retention (PR) of GFRP composites after hygrothermal ageing in various environments. Since the XGBoost model's performance was better than the RFR model, this application utilized a pre-trained XGBoost machine-learning model to make these predictions.
The app includes several features to facilitate user input and prediction. Categorical features are provided through dropdown menus, including resin type (with options for VE (Vinyl Ester), IPE (Isophthalic Polyester), and PE* (Unspecified Polyester)), production method (Pultrusion, Vacuum Infusion), exposure environment (Distilled water, Tap water immersion, Saltwater immersion, Indoor controlled environment, Continuous condensation), mechanical property (TS (Tensile Strength), ILSS (Interlaminar Shear Strength), TM (Tensile Modulus), FS (Flexural Strength)), and sustain loading type (No load, Pure tension, Bending). Continuous features are input through number fields with specified ranges as per the extreme values of these features in the trained model: thickness (1.4 to 7.1), temperature (20.0 to 66.0), sustained loading (0.0 to 58.0), and time (0.0 to 1097.5 days). Users shall input values for these nine features. Upon clicking the "Predict Property Retention" button, the app prepares the feature vector based on the input values and utilizes the pre-trained model to predict the property retention, displaying the predicted value. This application provides an easy-to-use interface for researchers and engineers to estimate the durability of GFRP composites under hygrothermal ageing conditions, aiding in structural design decisions.
